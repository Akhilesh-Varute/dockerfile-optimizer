ðŸ’¡ These Dockerfiles are available in the root directory for reference and comparison.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher
- **Docker**: Installed and running for validation and scanning
- **API Keys**: At least one of the following API keys configured in a .env file:
  - GEMINI_API_KEY (Google Gemini, recommended)
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - CLAUDE_API_KEY
  - PERPLEXITY_API_KEY

- **Dependencies**: Install required Python packages (see Setup).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** (or navigate to your project directory):
   ```
   https://github.com/Akhilesh-Varute/dockerfile-optimizer.git
   cd dockerfile-optimizer
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Example requirements.txt:
   ```
   python-dotenv
   google-generativeai
   rich
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:Create a .env file in the project root (V:\docker_optimizer\dockerfile-optimizer) with your API key(s):
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   # Optionally add other API keys
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   # CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
   # PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key
   ```

   Obtain a Gemini API key from Google Cloud Console.

## Usage
Run the optimization tool by providing the path to your Dockerfile:
```
python docker_optimizer.py
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Enter the path to your Dockerfile (e.g., V:\docker_optimizer\dockerfile-optimizer\Dockerfile).
2. Confirm the creation of a .dockerignore file (if not present).
3. Choose to add HEALTHCHECK instruction if missing.
4. Generate an enhanced security report with remediation examples and CI/CD integration.
5. Apply the optimized Dockerfile (creates a backup of the original).
6. Add vulnerability scanning comments to your Dockerfile.

- **Node.js Applications**: Handles npm/yarn, package.json, and production builds.
- **Python Applications**: Supports pip, requirements.txt, and slim Python images.
- **Generic Applications**: Provides a flexible template for other base images.

## Security Standards Enforced

### CIS Docker Benchmark
- User configuration (non-root)
- Trusted base images
- Minimal package installation
- Version-specific tags (no latest)
- Content trust verification
- Healthcheck configuration
- Proper update instructions
- Setuid/setgid permissions
- COPY vs ADD usage
- Secret management
- Package verification

### Container Security Best Practices
- Runtime security controls
- Image hardening techniques
- Supply chain security measures
- Configuration security patterns
- Operational security monitoring
- Resource limitation recommendations

## Limitations

- Currently supports Google Gemini AI; other providers (OpenAI, Claude, Perplexity) are not yet implemented.
- Image size and build time estimations are approximate and depend on the Dockerfile's complexity.
- Requires manual review of the optimized Dockerfile for application-specific requirements.
- Security assessments focus on static analysis and may not detect runtime vulnerabilities.
